# Advanced Chat Features (Optional Setup)

## Overview

The `/api/chat/completions` endpoint provides advanced features like:

- User authentication and sessions
- Chat history persistence
- User subscription management
- Project-based context
- Advanced AI conversation management

## Current Status

‚ùå **Not yet configured** - Requires additional setup

‚úÖ **Basic chat works perfectly** - The `/api/chat` endpoint provides full chat functionality

## What's Missing

### 1. Database Setup (Prisma)

- `@/lib/db` - Database connection module
- Prisma schema definition
- Database migrations

### 2. Authentication System

- `@/lib/auth` - Authentication middleware
- User session management
- JWT or session-based auth

### 3. AI Service Extension

- `@/lib/ai` - Extended AI service wrapper
- Message formatting utilities
- Advanced prompt management

## Do You Need Advanced Features?

**For most users**: The basic `/api/chat` endpoint provides everything needed:

- ‚úÖ Full OpenAI integration
- ‚úÖ General and workflow chat modes
- ‚úÖ Conversation history (in-memory)
- ‚úÖ Error handling and validation
- ‚úÖ Frontend integration

**Advanced features are only needed if you want**:

- Persistent chat history across browser sessions
- Multi-user support with authentication
- Subscription-based limitations
- Project-based chat contexts

## Setting Up Advanced Features (Future)

If you need the advanced features later, you'll need to:

1. **Set up Prisma database**:

   ```bash
   npm install prisma @prisma/client
   npx prisma init
   # Define schema and run migrations
   ```

2. **Create authentication system**:

   ```bash
   npm install next-auth
   # Set up auth providers and middleware
   ```

3. **Implement missing modules**:
   - `src/lib/db.ts` - Database connection
   - `src/lib/auth.ts` - Authentication middleware
   - `src/lib/ai.ts` - Extended AI service

## Current Recommendation

üéØ **Use the basic chat functionality** - it's production-ready and handles 90% of use cases perfectly.

The `/api/chat` endpoint provides:

- Full AI conversation capabilities
- Proper error handling
- Input validation
- Multiple chat modes
- Great user experience

Advanced features can be added later if needed, but most applications work great with the basic setup!
